# ISSDWCUSA94
Mod for the Sega Mega Drive game International Superstar Soccer Deluxe that replaces the fictional players' names with the real names of the athletes who participated in the 1994 World Cup

I've never been a big soccer fan, and my knowledge is limited, but I have fond memories of enthusiastically following the 1994 World Cup. Despite not being a sports enthusiast, I've always enjoyed classic soccer games, especially the 16-bit ones. Recently, while exploring the Romhacking.net website, I came across a tool called ISSDitor, created by ApioMan. This program allows for easy editing of the teams in International Superstar Soccer Deluxe.

I decided to use this tool to make ISSD compatible with the 1994 World Cup. The game includes 22 of the 24 teams that participated in the tournament, missing only Bolivia and Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it features several teams that did not qualify for the World Cup but competed in the 1993 qualifiers.

My first task was to edit all the World Cup teams, changing the players' last names to their real ones, respecting the jersey number and position whenever possible. For the teams that only competed in the qualifiers, I based my edits on the 1993 lineups, ignoring the jersey numbers, which varied during the qualifiers.

Players' names can only have up to 8 characters, resulting in many truncated or abbreviated names. Moreover, the game allows only 20 players per team (11 starters and 9 substitutes), meaning that two players from the original lineups will always be missing. Another restriction is the impossibility of assigning jersey numbers above 20, which causes errors in the game. Therefore, I had to make some adjustments, such as rearranging jersey numbers to maintain starters with numbers above 20.

Discovering the lineups of the teams that only participated in the qualifiers was challenging. In some cases, like Turkey, I couldn't find the exact lineup. To overcome this, I turned to AI, asking for the most probable players from that era.

I considered adjusting the players' skill points to better reflect the reality of the time, but this idea proved unfeasible. There isn't enough statistical data for a more precise evaluation, and using AI to estimate these ratings yielded unsatisfactory results. Many players ended up with identical skills, which doesn't reflect their diversity.

In the future, I might focus on adjusting the players' appearance and team uniforms, but for now, I don't have the time for that.

There are similar projects for the Super Nintendo, but I chose not to base my work on them. Instead, I preferred to seek data directly from sites like Transfermarkt (https://www.transfermarkt.com.br/weltmeisterschaft-1994/gesamtspielplan/pokalwettbewerb/WM94/saison_id/1993).
